            What does deforestation mean?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-justify italic">
            Deforestation is the intentional clearing of forested land. Trees
            are cut down for timber, waiting to be transported and sold.
            Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. <br />
            <br />
            Deforestation or forest clearance is the removal and destruction of
            a forest or stand of trees from land that is then converted to
            non-forest use. Deforestation can involve conversion of forest land
            to farms, ranches, or urban use. About 31% of Earth's land surface
            is covered by forests at present.

            Forest fires can be defined as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed
            combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a
            forest, grassland, brushland, or tundra, which consumes the natural
            fuels and spreads based on environmental conditions (e.g., wind,
            topography). <br /> <br />

          <p className="lg:text-2xl   hover:backdrop-blur-xl p-2 lg:p-4">
            Fuel, Oxygen, and heat sources help the spreading of wildfires: <br />
            Fuelis any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees,
            grasses, brush, and even homes. The greater an areaâ€™s fuel load, the
            more intense the fire. <br />
            Air supplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn.
            Heat sources help spark the wildfire and bring fuel to temperatures
            hot enough to ignite. <br />
            In nature, especially in higher latitude
            forests, fires help maintain a healthy forest ecosystem by releasing
            important nutrients into the soil and aiding seed dispersal.

        <li className="list-none">* Natural causes like lightning can set fires on trees which may be spread by wind. Sometimes, High atmospheric temperatures and dryness (low humidity) offer favorable circumstances for a fire to start.</li>
        <li className="list-none">* Man-made causes are usually the ones that become dangerous. Fire is caused when a source of fire like naked flame, cigarette, electric spark, or any source of ignition comes into contact with inflammable material.</li>
        <li className="list-none">* Other human-led causes are land clearing and other agricultural activities, maintenance of grasslands for livestock management, extraction of non-wood forest products, industrial development, resettlement, hunting, negligence, and arson.</li>

        <li>Wildfires emit billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which causes harm to climate and living organisms.</li>
        <li>This can also impact the carbon cycle due to excess CO2 and loss of vegetation.</li>
        <li>High-intensity forest fires destroy flora and fauna.</li>
        <li>Wildfires can impact the economy as many families and communities depend on the forest for food, fodder, and fuel.</li>
        <li>It burns down the small shrubs and grasses, leading to landslides and soil erosion.</li>
